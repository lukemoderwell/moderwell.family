### Currently We Are...

- loving the addition of a [fifth member](/indigo) to our family!
- taking a break from [playing music](https://www.annaandthedeeperwell.com/shows) to focus on our growing family but we will start back up with some shows in June.
- entering a new phase of parenting that focuses on training, teamwork and obedience. It's tricky but we hope that our kids come to enjoy the freedom that comes from discipline.
- enjoying summer weather and taking [a trip](/leatherwood) to the country.
- working on a top secret new business venture. More to come on this.

### Currently...

- We have just added a [fifth member](/indigo) to our family! Mom and baby Indigo are both in great health.
- We are taking a break from [playing music](https://www.annaandthedeeperwell.com/shows) to focus on our growing family but we will start back up with some shows in June.
- We've entered a new phase of parenting that focuses on training, teamwork and obedience. It's tricky but we hope that our kids come to enjoy the freedom that comes from discipline.

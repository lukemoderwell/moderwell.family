## Scottish Beginnings

The last name Moderwell comes from Scotland where it is thought to have originated from the town of [Motherwell](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Motherwell,+UK/@55.7934106,-4.0138431,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x4888134f0c2ae357:0x8108e0893e963536!8m2!3d55.7832092!4d-3.9810968) in the county of Lanarkshire. The [Internet Surname Database](https://www.surnamedb.com/Surname/Motherwell) says this about the surname Motherwell:

> Certainly the first known recording was that of John de Motherwell in 1244. He was a witness to a peace agreement between King Alexander 11nd of Scotland and England's King Henry 111rd. This would certainly suggest that this John de Motherwell was a person of considerable standing, and probably the lord of the manor of Motherwell. The spelling then underwent change as the national accent changed, and by 1296 the spelling was as Moderwell

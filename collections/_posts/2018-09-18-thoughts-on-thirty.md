I know, I know...no one wants to hear someone who is younger than them complain about getting older, but hear me out.  I know 30 isn’t old, but for some reason as a woman in music, 30 feels ancient!  I remember when I first started playing around town people would ask me, “how old are you?”  And when I told them they’d say things like, “You need to go on American Idol” or “you should move to Nashville!”  Then, suddenly around the age of 26 something strange started happening...I’d still get asked my age, but responses were always something like, “Good for you!”  or “Oh…”  No one flat out told me I was old, but I could feel the “window of opportunity” closing on me and they could too.  

The funny thing is that I never really wanted to “make it” in music.  I’ve always been a one foot in and one foot on the couch musician.  Don’t get me wrong, there isn’t much I love more than performing on stage, singing my favorite songs, and writing music.  But I also knew that someday I would be looking back at my career and I didn’t want to regret sacrificing the good stuff for the dream of fame.  So what is the good stuff?  

The good stuff is that I have gotten to play over 900 shows with my dad.  What!?  We never had a game plan for this whole music thing...hence never really creating our “brand” or even a band name until 13 years later.  But here we are, and what a gift it has been.  I could have spent this time down in Nashville playing at dive bars hoping for “exposure,”  but instead I got to know my dad and made hundreds of memories with him. 

The good stuff is having my husband come alongside us and join in.  When you said, “I do” did you ever think you’d be spending every weekend with your father-in-law?  My husband sure didn’t, but he has bought into and encourages the whole crew.  I look forward to the day when we’re in our rocking chairs and reminiscing about these very days.

The good stuff is meeting hundreds of people over the past 15 years from all walks of life and becoming united through one song, one dance, or one singular moment in time.  The stories we have heard and gotten to be a part of are humbling.

And finally, the good stuff is showing my three kids that being with family is better than being without.  When I have to leave them on the weekends they know I’m going to be with grandpa and dad.  Not to mention the deep relationship built between my kids and my own mom as she has watched them countless hours.

So what does all this have to do with turning 30?  Well, I guess it is a coming to terms with the fact that we all get old.  That’s hard.  That’s good.  I also want to remind myself that God doesn’t put an age limit on creativity.  I need that reminder daily as I’m in the grind of making PB&J’s and feelings like all I want to do at the end of the day is watch vlogs and eat chocolate chips from the bag.  I am still experiencing the good stuff and I want to sit in the gratefulness of it all, instead of the “what could have been” mindset.  As we all get older and realize the dreams of our childhood may not come to fruition, I want to encourage others that it may only look different than you imagined.  I’m not gracing the cover of Rolling Stone, but I’m covering “Like a Rolling Stone” and belting it out with my family and friends.
